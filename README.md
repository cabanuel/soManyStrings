# So Many Strings! : written in C and 32-bits

## Find the flag! 

### The Story:

I have a time on my hand some days, and I love teaching people some fun things. 
So a friend wants to learn more about hacking, CTFs, and all that fun stuff and being the helpful helper that I am 
(and because my GitHub needs more stuff), I am making CTF challenges for N00BS and people that just want to learn. So helpful! 

Some of these are trivial. Some of them like the CrackMe in the other repo are more challenging. 

So give it a whirl. And if you find the flag give me a shout on twitter!

Happy Hunting!

### The Challenge:

This one is simple. It's a binary. It prints to your screen a message. But somewhere in the binary there is also a function. 
In that function there is a print statement that has the flag.

### BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!

This function is never called by main! So figure out how to get that flag!

## Repository Contents:

**soManyStrings.c** contains the C program that was compiled. You will not get the flag through there but maybe it will help?

**soManyStrings** the flag is somewhere in this executable binary!

## Solution:

Again I have added a directory with the solution write up in the **solution** directory.
You can also find a solution hint [HERE] (https://bit.ly/1e1EYJv
